        Extract structured data from the following resume text. Return ONLY a JSON object with the exact structure below.

        CRITICAL: You MUST extract EVERY work experience you find. This is extremely important.
        
        STEP 1 - SCAN FOR EXPERIENCE SECTIONS:
        Look for sections labeled: EXPERIENCE, WORK HISTORY, PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE, EMPLOYMENT, CAREER
        Extract EVERY entry from these sections - no exceptions.
        
        STEP 2 - SCAN ENTIRE RESUME FOR WORK PATTERNS:
        1. Look for patterns like "Job Title | Company Name" or "Job Title - Company Name"
        2. Look for any entry with job responsibilities and date ranges
        3. Look for freelance, consulting, contract, part-time, full-time work
        4. Look for internships with professional duties
        5. Look for any role where someone performed work duties for pay
        
        STEP 3 - EXTRACT ALL FINDINGS:
        If you find ANY indication of work experience, extract it. 
        Do not skip entries because they seem "minor" or "short-term".
        Do not skip freelance or consulting work.
        Do not skip internships or part-time work.
        
        YOUR GOAL: Extract EVERY SINGLE work experience mentioned in this resume.
        
        Extract the following information and return as JSON:
        
        {{
          "firstName": "First name only",
          "lastName": "Last name only", 
          "phoneNumber": "Phone number without country code",

            "List of languages mentioned"
          ]
        }}
        
        CRITICAL EXPERIENCE EXTRACTION RULES:
        1. SCAN THE ENTIRE RESUME for any work experience patterns
        2. Look for these work experience indicators:
           - Job titles with company names (e.g., "Developer at Company", "Manager | Company")
           - Employment periods with dates (e.g., "2020-2023", "Jan 2020 - Present")
           - Job descriptions with bullet points or responsibilities
           - Freelance, consulting, contract, part-time, full-time work
           - Internships, co-ops, volunteer positions with responsibilities
           - Any role where someone was performing work duties
        3. Extract experience from ANY section that contains work activities:
           - Traditional "Experience" or "Work History" sections
           - "Professional Experience" sections
           - Mixed sections that contain both projects AND work experience
           - Individual project descriptions that show ongoing work relationships
        4. For each experience found, extract:
           - Job title/role
           - Company/organization name
           - Start date (any format: MM/YYYY, Month Year, Year only)
           - End date (including "Present", "Current", "Ongoing")
           - Location if mentioned
           - Responsibilities/achievements
        5. If you find dates and responsibilities but unclear company, mark company as "Freelance" or "Various Clients"
        6. Extract ALL education entries (multiple schools/degrees should be separate entries)
        7. Extract ALL projects from technical/personal projects sections
        8. For skills, extract both technical and soft skills mentioned
        9. Do not hallucinate or guess information not in the resume
        10. Be AGGRESSIVE in finding work experiences - look for any indication of paid or professional work
        11. Focus on accuracy over completeness
        
        EXAMPLE PATTERNS TO RECOGNIZE AS WORK EXPERIENCE:
        - "Software Developer | ABC Company | 2020-2022"
        - "Freelance Web Developer | Various Clients | 2019-Present"  
        - "Freelancing Web Developer | Self-Employed, April 2025 - Present"
        - "Consultant | Self-Employed | June 2021 - Current"
        - "Marketing Intern | XYZ Corp | Summer 2020"
        - "Part-time Developer | Tech Startup | Jan 2019 - Dec 2020"
        - Any role with dates and responsibilities, even if in a "Projects" section
        
        SPECIFIC EXAMPLE - If you see this pattern in a resume:
        
        "EXPERIENCE
        
        Freelancing Web Developer | Self-Employed,  
        April 2025 - Present | Remote"
        
        You MUST extract it as:
        {{
          "title": "Freelancing Web Developer",
          "company": "Self-Employed", 
          "startDate": "April 2025",
          "endDate": "Present",
          "location": "Remote",
          "description": "[any bullet points or responsibilities that follow]"
        }}
        
        CRITICAL: If you see a section called "EXPERIENCE", extract EVERY entry from it - no exceptions!
